# MeetupNov2020

This project was created based on the [tutorial by Strigifo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwmGmCVti_dBFcOnCXmpFpg58SmiZZVEt).

I've created 3 tags so that you should be able to better see the evolution of this project:
* [0.5](https://github.com/mmischitelli/MeetupNov2020/releases/tag/0.5) : First playable version which is 99.9% â„¢ Blueprint-based.
* [1.0](https://github.com/mmischitelli/MeetupNov2020/releases/tag/1.0) : Ported most of the classes and logic from Blueprint to C++.
* [1.1](https://github.com/mmischitelli/MeetupNov2020/releases/tag/1.1) : Evolution of the C++ implementation with a slightly better architecture and more correct use of UE4's GameModes.
